Web performance :
-----

1. Network 
    - HTML Streaming 
    - Compression 
        - Gzip, brotli, deflate 
    - CDN 
    

2. Code 

    Loading techniques :
        - prefetch 
            - low priority fetch resources and cache them
        - preload 
            - highest priority load resources 
        - preconnect 
            - network data cached from third party domains (like DNS resolution, tcp handshake)
    
    Code splitting :
        - JS chunking based on routes (react router, nextjs)
        - CSS chunking (could be based on routes / exports)
        - Critical CSS  (optimising CRP)
            - build time (using puppeteer)
                <html> <style> ... </style> ...</html>
            - run time (CSS-in-JS) React 
                - EmotionJS
                - Styled components 
                - PandaJS
